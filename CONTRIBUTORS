# This is the official list of people who have contributed code to
# elastic-search-api.
#
# The AUTHORS file lists the copyright holders; this file lists people. For
# example, Globo.com employees are listed here but not in AUTHORS, because
# Globo.com holds the copyright.
#
# You can update this list using the following command:
#
# % git shortlog -se | awk '{print $2 " " $3 " " $4}'
#
# Please keep this file sorted, and group users with multiple emails.
